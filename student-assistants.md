In preparation for DAT320 in Fall 2021, we are now recruiting student assistants for several positions, including summer jobs.
This will be an excellent opportunity for the selected students to gain experience, and I hope many of you apply for this role.

## Summer Projects (Two Positions)

There are two projects available, each with a time budget of 120 hours.

The students that are selected for these projects are expected to work together on both projects.
If you apply for these two projects, you will also be hired for teaching assistance in Fall 2021.

### 1 - Prepare lightning talks and demonstrations for DAT320 students

This project aims to strengthen social relations between the students through social events with demos and lightning talks on subject matter related to DAT320.
The goal is to organize two or three such events during the semester.
The project will develop several demos and lightning talks to be delivered at these social events.
The focus could be on demonstrating practical coding examples, helpful hints, tricks, and practical setup of development environments.
Example topics include ssh config, WSL config, terminal tricks, VSCode Go plugin config, and more.
The actual topics are to be decided.

The main work should be carried out in the summer months: June, July, or early August.
The actual execution of the plans will be carried out during the semester.

PS: We hope to get support to get Pizza for the social events.

### 2 - Improve the lab assignments for DAT320

This project will conduct a critical review of the lab assignments, as viewed from a student perspective, and propose improvements and simplifications based on this review.
The improvements can include, but are not limited to:

- improved Quickfeed tests with better feedback
- provide partial solution examples to existing assignments
- improved assignments descriptions
- remove less helpful assignments
- add new and better assignment(s)
